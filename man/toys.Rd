\title{A simulated dataset called toys data}
\format{The format is a list of 2 component:

$x: A data-frame containing input variables: with 100 obs. of 200
variables ;

$y: Output variable: a factor with 2 levels "-1" and "1".}

\description{
\code{toys} is a simple simulated dataset of a binary classification
problem, introduced by Weston et.al..
}
\details{
It is an equiprobable two class problem, Y belongs to {-1,1}, with six
true  variables, the others being some noise.
The simulation model is defined through the conditional distribution
of the Xi for Y=y:

with probability 0.7, X^j ~ N(yj,1) for j=1,2,3 and
X^j ~ N(0,1) for j=4,5,6 ;

with probability 0.3, X^j ~ N(0,1) for j=1,2,3 and
X^j ~ N(y(j-3),1) for j=4,5,6 ;

the other variables are noise, X^j ~ N(0,1)
for j=7,\dots,p.

After simulation, the obtained variables are finally standardized.
